## 🍃 MongoDB Setup — IMPORTANT

> Every person who clones this project must have **MongoDB running on their own machine**.
> The database is not shared — each person seeds their own local copy using `npm run seed`.

Once MongoDB is running, use this in `Backebnd/.env`:

> MongoDB will automatically create the `college_erp` database on first connection. No manual setup needed.



## 📥 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RonakMahajan/College_ERP


### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate into the backend folder:

```bash
cd Backebnd
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `Backebnd/` folder:

```bash


Open `.env` and add the following:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=Yourl_MongoDB_URL
JWT_SECRET=college_erp_super_secret_key_2026
NODE_ENV=development
```

`

Seed the database with demo data (institutions, programs, users):

```bash
npm run seed
```

Start the backend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

✅ Backend will be running at: **`http://localhost:5000`**

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend folder from the project root:

```bash
cd Frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `Frontend/` folder:




Open `.env` and add the following:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

✅ Frontend will be running at: **`http://localhost:5173`**

---

## 🌐 Open the App

Once both servers are running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🔄 Admission Workflow

### Government Flow (KCET / COMEDK)
1. **Create Applicant** → Set quota type as `KCET` or `COMEDK`, enter allotment number
2. **Allocate Seat** → System checks if quota has available seats (blocks if full)
3. **Document Status** → Pending → Submitted → Verified
4. **Fee Status** → Paid
5. **Confirm Admission** → System generates unique admission number

### Management Flow
1. **Create Applicant** → Set quota type as `Management`
2. **Allocate Seat** → Same quota check applies
3. Steps 3–5 are the same as above

---

## 🔑 Key Business Rules

```
1. Quota seats ≤ Intake (validated on save)
2. Seat allocation blocked if quota is full
3. Admission number generated ONCE and never changed
4. Admission confirmed ONLY if fee = Paid
5. Seat counters update in real-time on allocation
6. Admin-only: Masters setup and user management
7. Management role: View-only access to dashboard
```
